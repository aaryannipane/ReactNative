-check connected devices 
$adb devices

-create react-native project 
$npx react-native init <project-name>
# don't start project name with number

connect your device with debugging on

-run app on android device 
$npx react-native run-android
new window pop up select 'a'
$a 


we will get error. To solve this error we have to create file in folder android 
projectName/android 
    local.properties
        // for android
        sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\aryan\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

after creating file again run the same command
$npx react-native run-android
new window pop up select 'a'
$a
